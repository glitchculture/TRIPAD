# TRIPAD
TRIPAD is a touch-controlled multiplayer game 'platform', designed for three simultaneous players. It is constructed from three Novation LaunchPad Mini devices, arranged in a configuration that naturally encourages interaction between all three playing surfaces. Each player is provided with 80 input buttons, which double as 'pixels'.

TRIPAD is to be shown at GDC 2015 during the Experimental Gameplay Workshop session and in the Alt.Ctrl.GDC 'alternative controller' exhibit.

This repository is currently a placeholder, for use after I clean up the code and document the construction of the device.  More information on TRIPAD can be found at http://alexk.net/tripad/.
