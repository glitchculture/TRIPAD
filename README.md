# TRIPAD
TRIPAD is a touch-controlled multiplayer game 'platform', designed for three simultaneous players. It is constructed from three Novation LaunchPad Mini devices, arranged in a configuration that naturally encourages interaction between all three playing surfaces. Each player is provided with 80 input buttons, which double as 'pixels'.

This repository is currently a placeholder, for use after I clean up the code and document the construction of the device.  More information on TRIPAD can be found at http://alexk.net/tripad/.
